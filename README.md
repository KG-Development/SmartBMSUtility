## About this repository
This repository is intended to track issues and minor feature requests. I have removed any relevant file from my Xcode workspace to avoid users compiling it for their own use, as I intend to sell this tool for $0.49.

## Contributing
You can contribute to this project by submitting untested code changes that I will test with my workspace.
To contribute to this project and test it with the whole project, I can give you access to my private repository if you can prove that you have a current Apple developer license. This requirement could be waived, as it only serves to prevent other users from compiling for themselves.
Contact me by e-mail, Discord @NeariX#4799 or Twitter (link in my profile) to gain access to my private repository containing all code.
