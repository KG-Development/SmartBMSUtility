# Status: In review

## About this repository
This repository is intended to track issues and minor feature requests. I have removed any relevant file from my Xcode workspace to avoid users compiling it for their own use, as I intend to make some in-app purchases or sell this tool for $1.09.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this application, I can give you access if you can prove that you have a current Apple developer license. This requirement could be waived as it is only to prevent other users from compiling for themselves.
Contact me by e-mail, Discord @NeariX#4799 or Twitter (link in my profile) to gain access to my private repository containing all code.

## MacOS Support
This app will come to the MacOS as soon as i optimized the UI for larger screens.


# To-Do:
* LiFePo support
* Logging
* Configuration
* Stability improvements (Reconnect device for example)
* MacOS support
* Add more languages
* Fancy UI
